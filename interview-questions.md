3. What is a React component?

Your answer:Components are reusable code. They can either be be a logic component or a display component. To use components in your application, you need to have a component call. 

Researched answer: Components are like functions that return that return HTMl elements. Components are independent and reusable bits on code. They serve the same purpose as JavaScript funtions, but work in isolation and return HTML. Componenets come in two types, logic components and display componenets. If a compoenet is holding data in a state variable it is refered to as a logic component. It a component does not hold state it is considered a display component. When creating a React component, the componenet's name must start with an upper case letter. 

4. What is the difference between state values and props in React?

Your answer: State values are variables that will change as the user interactions with the application. Props are passed through component properties.

1. Object-oriented programming: sections of areas of code that performs certain procedures so programs are the interation of many small parts

2. Ruby:is an object-oriented language

3. Implicit return: if there is no return specified the value of the last line of a method is automatically returned. 

4. Ruby blocks: is an anonymous fuction that is passed to a method to determine the outcome. blocks are typicaaly defeined with the ruby keywords do adn the end.

5. Ruby hashes: collection of unique keys and their values. the values are reference by their unique key.
